        <h3>Renewable Energy</h3>
        <br>
        <img class="img2" src="images/green-energy.jpeg" alt="renewable-energy">
        <br>
        <p class="txt-gall">Renewable energy is energy derived from natural sources that are replenished at a higher rate than they are consumed. Sunlight and wind, for example, are such sources that are constantly being replenished. Renewable energy sources are plentiful and all around us.Fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - on the other hand, are non-renewable resources that take hundreds of millions of years to form. Fossil fuels, when burned to produce energy, cause harmful greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide. Generating renewable energy creates far lower emissions than burning fossil fuels. Transitioning from fossil fuels, which currently account for the lion's share of emissions, to renewable energy is key to addressing the climate crisis. Renewables are now cheaper in most countries, and generate three times more jobs than fossil fuels.</p>

        <h3>Clean Water for Everyone</h3>
        <br>
        <img class="img2" src="images/water.jpg" alt="clean-water">
        <br>
        <p class="txt-gall">One in three people live without sanitation. This is causing unnecessary disease and death. Although huge strides have been made with access to clean drinking water, lack of sanitation is undermining these advances. If we provide affordable equipment and education in hygiene practices, we can stop this senseless suffering and loss of life. In 2022, 2.2 billion people still lacked safely managed drinking water, including 703 million without a basic water service; 3.5 billion people lacked safely managed sanitation, including 1.5 billion without basic sanitation services; and 2 billion lacked a basic handwashing facility, including 653 million with no handwashing facility at all.

        <h3>Waste Reduction</h3>
        <br>
        <img class="img2" src="images/waste-reduction.jpg" alt="waste-reduction">
        <br>
        <p class="txt-gall">Waste reduction, also known as source reduction, is the practice of using less material and energy to minimize waste generation and preserve natural resources. Waste reduction is broader in scope than recycling and incorporates ways to prevent materials from ending up as waste before they reach the recycling stage. Waste reduction includes reusing products such as plastic and glass containers, purchasing more durable products, and using reusable products, such as dishrags instead of paper towels. Donating products, from office equipment to eyeglasses and clothing, reduces the amount of material manufactured overall. Purchasing products that replace hazardous materials with biodegradable ingredients reduces pollution as well as waste. In general, waste reduction offers several environmental benefits.</p>

        <h3>Sustainability Education and Awareness</h3>
        <br>
        <img class="img2" src="images/sustainability-education.jpeg" alt="sustainability-education">
        <br>
        <p class="txt-gall">Education allows every human being to acquire the knowledge, skills, attitudes  and values necessary to shape a sustainable future. Sustainability Education and Awareness means including key sustainable development issues into teaching and learning; for example, climate change, disaster risk reduction, biodiversity, poverty reduction, and sustainable consumption. It also requires participatory teaching and learning methods that motivate and empower learners to change their behaviour and take action for sustainable development. Sustainability Education and Awareness consequently promotes competencies like critical thinking, imagining future scenarios and making decisions in a collaborative way.</p>

        <h3>Green Architecture</h3>
        <br>
        <img class="img2" src="images/green-architecture.jpg" alt="green-architecture">
        <br>
        <p class="txt-gall">Green architecture is a philosophy that advocates for building with the environment in mind by using sustainable sources of energy, designing efficiently to reduce energy use, and updating existing buildings with new technology. Green architecture counteracts the impact of humankind by creating more sustainable ways for us to live on this planet. This type of architecture does not mean abandoning all the creature comforts we enjoy in the 21st century. It means embracing new technologies that have become more and more accessible.</p>

        <h3>Community Gardens</h3>
        <br>
        <img class="img2" src="images/community-gardens.jpg" alt="community-gardens">
        <br>
        <p class="txt-gall">Community gardens are often created on waste pieces of land that are being dumped in or look unsightly, or on land that isn't being used. They are ideal places to join if you enjoy gardening with other people, if you feel overwhelmed by gardening on your own, if you live in an apartment or don't have much space to grow your own food, or only have a couple of hours to spare but want to do something productive outside. Some community gardens only grow vegetables, some grow vegetables and flowers, some open every day, others for a couple of hours a week. Some gardens only house the one group of gardeners in the community, others might invite several groups in to share the land. They might be postcard sized or a couple of acres. Some community gardens only garden, others include activities such as food cook ups, talks, plays and shows or become environmental hubs.</p>
